    "In 2015, Google DeepMind ([Link](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/)) published a paper in Nature magazine that combines a deep convolution neural network with reinforcement learning for the first time in order to master a range of Atari 2600 games. They used only the raw pixels and score as the inputs. They were able to use the convolution layer to translate the pixels.  \n",

    "The very simple description is that they replaced the Q table in a Q-Learner with a neural network. This allowed them to take advantage of neural networks but still use reinforcement learning. "

    "To perform an experience replay, the algorithm stores all of the agents experiences {$s_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1}$} at each time step in a data set. During the learning/training process, they apply q-learning updates on samples (or batches) of experiences. These are drawn uniformly at random from the pool of stored samples."

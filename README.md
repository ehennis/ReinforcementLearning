# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
**Author**: Evan Hennis  
**Summary**: This repository is for CS6460 Education Technology Fall 2018. My project will be to create content that will teach reinforcement learning. I will start with the basics of RL (Decision making, MDP, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration) and then work through Q-Learning and all of its enhancements (Double Q-Learning, DQN, and Double DQN).  
**Repository Instructions**: To use this repository you will need to find the section you want to learn and open the notebook associated with it.

## Section 1: Reinforcement Learning Basics
**Topics Covered** Decision Making, Markov Decision Process, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Deterministic Movements, and Stochastic Movements. ??Maybe reference discrete and continuous environments here??  
**Notebook**: 01-RLBasics.ipynb

## Section 2: Q-Learning

# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
**Author**: Evan Hennis  
**Summary**: This repository is for CS6460 Education Technology Fall 2018. My project will be to create content that will teach reinforcement learning. I will start with the basics of RL (Decision making, MDP, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration) and then work through Q-Learning and all of its enhancements (Double Q-Learning, DQN, and Double DQN).  
**Repository Instructions**: To use this repository you will need to find the section you want to learn and open the notebook associated with it.

## Section 1: Reinforcement Learning Basics
**Topics Covered:** Decision Making, Markov Decision Process, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Deterministic Movements, and Stochastic Movements. ??Maybe reference discrete and continuous environments here??  
**Notebook:**: [01-RLBasics.ipynb](01-RLBasics.ipynb)

## Section 2: Q-Learning
**Topics Covered:** Q-Learning, Discrete Environments, and Continuous Environments  
**Notebook:** [02-QLearning.ipynb](02-QLearning.ipynb)

## Section 3: Double Q-Learning
**Notebook:** [03-DoubleQLearning.ipynb](03-DoubleQLearning.ipynb)

## Section 4: Neural Networks
**Notebook:** [04-NeuralNetworks.ipynb](04-NeuralNetworks.ipynb)

## Section 5: DQN
**Notebook:** [05-DQN.ipynb](05-DQN.ipynb)

## Section 6: Double DQN
**Notebook:** [06-DDQN.ipynb](06-DDQN.ipynb)

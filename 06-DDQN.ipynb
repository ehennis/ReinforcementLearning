    "In 2016, Google DeepMind ([Link](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12389/11847)) decided to alter the DQN algorithm the same way the original Q-Learner algorithm was updated by adding a second network. The team found that the overestimation that affected the q-learner also affected the DQN algoritm. When the original double q-learner was introduced they proved that it worked in that setting and in this paper they prove it can be generalized to work with large scale function approximation."

    "**Summary**  \n",
    "This algorithm combines the benefits of the Double Q-Learner as the benefits of deep learning. We get the function approximation so that we can have a continuous state space plus we keep from having the overestimation from Q-Learning. This document will be a combination of the DQN and Double Q-Learner so it will be mostly review. But, this algorithm is so much more powerful that you should explore the other gyms at OpenAI and see what you can solve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note, we need to update the weights of the second neural network with the weights from the first neural network. We didn't do this in the Double Q-Learner since the tables were both getting updated."

    "Again we will use the [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) environment from OpenAI.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The actions are 0 to push the cart to the left and 1 to push the cart to the right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous state space is an X coordinate for location, the velocity of the cart, the angle of the pole, and the velocity at the tip of the pole. The X coordinate goes from -4.8 to +4.8, velocity is -Inf to +Inf, angle of the pole goes from -24 degrees to +24 degrees, tip velocity is -Inf to +Inf. With all of the possible combinations you can see why we can't create a Q table for each one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To \"solve\" this puzzle you have to have an average reward of > 195 over 100 consecutive episodes. One thing to note, I am hard capping the rewards at 210 so this number can't average above that and it also could potentially drive the average down."

    "In psychology, decision-making is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief. In economics, it is the act of deciding on matters of the economy given certain indicators. In neuroscience, there are studies that show various brain regions work together during the decision-making process. These studies are expanded to try and figure out addictions and other self-control related items. In statistics, there are statistical decisions which are made on the basis of observations of a phenomenon that obeys probabilistic laws that are not completely known. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to say that making decisions are all over every part of our lives. We take in inputs, do some processing, and output a decision. Some situations we have a full working model of our environment and other times we have to use probabilities. If we can take all of these areas of study, we can attempt to recreate how humans make decisions and transfer that to artificial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, I will work through one type of decision-making algorithm called Q-learning. Q-learning is a type of reinforcement learning where we are given rewards for actions in an attempt to learn a policy to navigate an environment. In a Markov Decision Process (MDP), Q-learning will find an optimal policy given infinite exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Q-learning, I will go through some enhancements. The first is Double Q-learning which was created by Hado van Hasselt in 2010. Double Q-learning uses a second “off-policy” to evaluation the next action. This second policy is used because in a noisy environment the action value can be overestimated and slow learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Double Q-learning, I will cover Deep Q-network (DQN) which was created by Google DeepMind 2015. DQN uses a neural network for the internal Q table. This allows a much larger (even continuous) environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I will cover Double DQN which was created by Google DeepMind in 2016. It uses DQN but adds a second “off-policy” network to evaluate the next action.\n",

    "Markov Decision Process (MDP) provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making. It is a discrete time (distinct points in time) stochastic (randomly determined) process.\n",

    "A: Finite set of actions (Ex: North, South, East, West)  \n",

    "$\\gamma$: The discount factor between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This determines how much you want to give the future path credit. If you think that the future reward is as important as the current reward you would set this to 0.99999. If you don't care about the future rewards you would set this to 0 and you only care about the current reward. Both of these are bad ideas. You want to find a place in the middle that will take into account expected future rewards but not too much.\n",

    "An MDP is a collection of states that each have a selection of actions associated with them. With each action comes a reward (can be 0). The solution to an MDP is the policy ($\\pi$). That policy will determine the optimal action to take at each state to maximize the reward. Typically, in an MDP only the current state matters. You want the optimal policy for that state based on the available actions.  \n",

    "I don't want to get too technical but I do need to give the equation that you would use to find the optimal policy. It is the Bellman Equation. At the end of this section I recommend you research it some more if you want to get in the weeds. You will also find a man that has shaped where we are today. The following equation is finding the expected reward at state s following some fixed policy $\\pi$:  \n",

    "$\\sum$: This is the sum of the probabilities of each action mutliplied by its expected value.  \n",
    "$P(s'|s, \\pi(s))$:  Probability of going from state s to state s' using the expected policy of s  \n",
    "$V^\\pi(s')$: Expected value of state s'. Isn't recursion wonderful??  \n",
